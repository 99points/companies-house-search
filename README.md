# Companies House Search

A Laravel-based modular monolithic application for searching and browsing companies across multiple countries.  
Designed for scalability, easy onboarding of new countries, and lightning-fast search.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Modular Monolithic Architecture**  
  Business logic is cleanly separated into modules (e.g., Company Registry), but remains a single deployable Laravel application.  

  Adding a new country is as simple as:
  - Add DB connection in `.env`

```bash
DB_UK_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_UK_PORT=8889
DB_UK_DATABASE=companies_house_uk
DB_UK_USERNAME=root
DB_UK_PASSWORD=root

  - Add provider entry in `config/company_providers.php` (no new PHP class needed).

- **Multi-Country Support**  
  Currently supports:
  - SG (Singapore)
  - MX (Mexico)
  - UK (United Kingdom)

- **High-Performance Full-Text Search**  
  Powered by [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) â€” blazing fast, can handle millions of records with proper server resources.

```bash
MEILISEARCH_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:7700
MEILISEARCH_KEY=masterKey

- **Pagination & Merged Data**  
  When no search query is given, the system loads company data from all connected countries, merges, and paginates them seamlessly.
